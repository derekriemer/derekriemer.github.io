404,
It does not exist.

404,
something went amiss.

you are here right now,
I can't find the page,
You are here I regrete,
There is an error it seems.

Go away,
This is the wrong page,
Go away, 
nothing is here I say.

Its time to look, on top of the page,
for that thing that says www.something. and prey,
That the page you want is not really here.

Try again,
Don't cry, please;
Its just an error, it's okay, oh jees.

If you clicked on a link,
The author is quite dumb,
For they linked to somewhere,
That is nothing at all.

If you are that person,
Who wrote the link,
Go drink some coffey, 
Go get some sleep.

Goodbye for now,
I wish you luck,
In finding the page,
You wanted to have.

If this is my error,
write me please,
If this is my error,
my appologies.
